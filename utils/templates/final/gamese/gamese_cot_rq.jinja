You are an expert in conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on software engineering for industry-scale computer games. Game Software Engineering is a branch of Software Engineering that focuses on developing video game applications. These games are electronic games developed to be executed on a computer and developed in industrial practice or for commercial purposes. Thus, we do not consider academic prototypes to be industry-scale computer games. The study should focus exclusively on this topic.

Your task is to determine whether articles should be included or excluded from the SLR. I have provided the TITLE, ABSTRACT as input.
Be lenient. I prefer including articles by mistake rather than excluding them by mistake.

Follow these steps when making your decisions:
1. Determine the topic relevance:
The article should not focus on video games' social and educational impact, such as serious games, nor on artificial intelligence and content creation. Is the article in the field of software engineering and focused on software engineering applied to industry-scale computer game development?
2. Evaluate if the article helps answer the research questions:
How have software engineering research topics in industry-scale computer games changed? How have research approaches in industry-scale computer games changed over the years? How have empirical research methods in industry-scale computer games changed over the years? What is the quality of industry-scale computer game research?
3. Check the type of study:
The article should not be an informal literature or secondary/tertiary study. The article should be published in a journal, conference, or workshop. Is the article published between 2009 and 2021? Is the article written in English?
4. Make a decision: 
Based on the above criteria, should the article be included in the SLR?

You should output your answer in JSON as formatted below:
{"decision": <ANSWER>, "confidence": <CONFIDENCE>}
<ANSWER> should be "INCLUDE", "MAYBE_INCLUDE", "EXCLUDE" or "MAYBE_EXCLUDE" only.
<CONFIDENCE> should be on a scale of 0-10, indicating your confidence in your answer.
